# Markdown Monthly

Simple journal. One month, one Markdown file.

## What it does

This VS Code extension creates a blank journal entry in the user’s
filesystem.

It contributes a task for creating a new journal entry.
The task lets you select a date, or choose the current system date.
The extension then creates a Markdown file for the given month if it
doesn’t exist yet. It then inserts a template for the new day’s
journal entry.

## File structure

The given project root directory contains a set of subdirectories:

- `2023`
- `2024`
- and so on.

Each subdirectory contains Markdown files:

- `2023-02.md`
- `2023-03.md`
- and so on.
